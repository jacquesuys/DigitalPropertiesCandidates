# KURTOSYS Front-end test

## Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to assess candidate’s front-end development skills. Candidates are expected to develop a working solution for the requirement explained below.  

## Requirement
To build an angular application for displaying fund information.

## Instructions
1.	Create an angular application which shows fund information on a page. Use the attached JSON file as source.
2.	Use yeoman to build the project and generator-angular-feature to generate the project structure (divide “by feature”)
3.	Make an HTTP call to retrieve the JSON file and display the following properties.
•	"Fund Size" 
•	"Launch Date" formatted as DD.MM.YYYY
•	"Ticker Symbol"
•	and any other properties
4.	Perform necessary formatting of the fields.
•	Amounts with thousands separators
•	Dates with DD.MM.YYYY
•	“- -” for blank values

## Project structure
The project structure should follow the angular team's recommendation, dividing the functionality into "modules"
You can use any kind of `yeoman` generator to create the structure, like:
- https://github.com/codigo-pl/generator-angular-feature
- https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack
- https://github.com/cgross/generator-cg-angular

## Development
- Don't make any design, or keep it minimal, we're interested in how you code :)
- Feel free to use any library which makes the development easier and faster
- Make sure the project can be easily extended. Write clean, easily understandable code. Make sure your code is consistent along the whole project
- Keep in mind others might have to read, learn and change your code in the future
- Create tests for directives, controllers and services. E2E test is optional


## How to send the test?
- Fork this repository and make the changes on it
- Commit as many states as you can while developing
- Send only the link to your repository. **DON'T CREATE A PULL-REQUEST!**
